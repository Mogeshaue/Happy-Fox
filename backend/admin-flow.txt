## 5. Frontend (UI/UX) Guidelines

- Use forms for creation and editing.
- Use tables or lists for viewing entities.
- Provide filters (e.g., by course or cohort) where helpful.
- Show clear success/error messages for all actions.
- Only show admin features to authorized users.

---

## 6. Extensibility

- Models and APIs are designed for easy extension (e.g., add more fields, roles, or features).
- Code should be modular and follow best practices for maintainability.
